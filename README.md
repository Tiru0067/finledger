# FinLedger

A backend REST API for managing financial records with role-based access control.

**Live API:** https://finledger-ufpb.onrender.com/api

> ⚠️ Hosted on Render's free tier. First request may take up to 50 seconds if the server has been idle.

---

## What This Project Does

FinLedger is an internal finance dashboard API. Different users have different levels of access depending on their role — a viewer can only see records, an analyst can also access financial insights, and an admin has full control over records and users.

The goal was to build a clean, well-structured backend that handles:

- User authentication with JWT
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Financial record management (create, read, update, soft delete)
- Dashboard summary endpoints (totals, trends, category breakdowns)
- Input validation and proper error handling

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or higher
- A PostgreSQL database (the project uses [Neon](https://neon.tech) — a free serverless Postgres)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tiru0067/finledger.git
cd finledger
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Copy the example file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_postgres_connection_string
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5001
SECRET_KEY=any_long_random_string_for_jwt

# These are used to create the first admin account on startup
ADMIN_NAME=Arjun Mehta
ADMIN_EMAIL=arjun@finledger.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=Arjun@123
```

### 4. Run database migrations

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### 5. Seed the database (creates the super admin)

```bash
node prisma/seed.js
```

### 6. Start the server

```bash
# Development (auto-restarts on file changes)
npm run dev

# Production
npm start
```

The server runs at `http://localhost:5001`.

## Key Design Decisions

### JWT Authentication

Tokens are signed with a secret key and expire after 8 hours. Every protected route runs `authMiddleware` which verifies the token and checks that the user still exists and is active.

### Role-Based Access Control

The `authorize(...roles)` middleware accepts a list of allowed roles and blocks the request with a `403 Forbidden` if the logged-in user's role isn't in that list.

### Soft Deletes for Records

Records are never permanently deleted. Instead, a `deletedAt` timestamp is set. This preserves financial history. Soft-deleted records are hidden from normal queries but visible to admins via `?includeDeleted=true`.

### Super Admin

The first admin created via seed is marked as `isSuperAdmin: true`. This account cannot be deactivated or modified through the API, protecting the system from being locked out.

### No Public Registration

There is no `POST /api/auth/register`. Only admins can create users via `POST /api/users`. This is intentional — it keeps the system internal and controlled.

### Users start as Viewer

When an admin creates a new user, the role defaults to `viewer`. The admin must explicitly update the role afterwards. This follows the principle of least privilege.

---

## Validation

All inputs are validated before reaching the database:

- Missing required fields return a clear error: `"Amount and Category are required"`
- Invalid email format is rejected
- Password must be at least 7 characters with uppercase, lowercase, a number, and a special character
- Invalid enum values (wrong type or category) return the list of valid options
- Invalid IDs (non-numeric) are caught before the database query

---

## Error Handling

All errors flow through a centralized `errorHandler` middleware. Responses always follow this format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Descriptive error message here"
}
```

Common status codes used:

- `400` — bad input or invalid operation
- `401` — not authenticated or wrong credentials
- `403` — authenticated but not authorized
- `404` — resource not found
- `409` — conflict (e.g. email already exists)
- `500` — unexpected server error

---

## Testing the API

An `api.http` file is included in the root of the project. If you're using VS Code, install the [REST Client extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) to run requests directly from the file.

1. Login as admin and copy the token
2. Paste it into the `@adminToken` variable at the top of `api.http`
3. Run any request from the file

---

## Test Credentials

The following users are pre-seeded for testing:

| Name        | Email               | Password  | Role    | Status   |
| ----------- | ------------------- | --------- | ------- | -------- |
| Arjun Mehta | arjun@finledger.com | Arjun@123 | Admin   | Active   |
| Priya Nair  | priya@finledger.com | Priya@123 | Analyst | Active   |
| Ravi Kumar  | ravi@finledger.com  | Ravi@123  | Viewer  | Active   |
| Sneha Das   | sneha@finledger.com | Sneha@123 | Viewer  | Inactive |

---

## Assumptions Made

- Financial amounts are stored as `Decimal(15, 2)` to avoid floating point issues with money
- The `date` field on records represents the transaction date, not the creation date
- Inactive users cannot log in, even with a valid token
- Category is an enum defined at the schema level — open-ended strings are not allowed
- The API is designed for internal use only — there is no public-facing registration

---

## What Could Be Improved (Given More Time)

- Filtering records by date range, category, or type (query params on `GET /api/records`)
- Pagination on list endpoints
